# mr-poopybutthole

A hilariously useless Discord bot.

## usage

I am going to encapsulate this into a Kubernetes manifest to make for easier deployment, but in the meantime, I am running this in Docker as follows:

`$ docker build --tag mr-poopybutthole:<version>`

`$ docker run -d -name mr-poopybutthole mr-poopybutthole:<version>`
