    I am a handy-dandy bot that is a one-stop meme shop! My memes are split into three categories:

    **Commands** - These are commands I accept that start with a `!`, such as `!oohwee` or `!ole`!

    **Listeners** - I'll say these when you say the right things in your messages, such as `adonis` `superman`! They'll pop up even if you don't expect them to!

    **Snowflake Mode** - A super-special troll mode for all you special snowflakes out there! Type `!snowflake on` to start the party!

    Sometimes, you just gotta troll someone, right? Snowflake Mode does just that to this server's certain special snowflakes!

    Turning it on will make me respond to *all* the snowflake's messages and even change their nicknames!

    I'll keep going until you retreat to your safe space or someone turns off Snowflake Mode!
