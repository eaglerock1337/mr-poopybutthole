      I am a handy-dandy bot that is a one-stop meme shop! My memes are split into three categories:

      **Commands** - These are commands I accept that start with a `!`, such as `!oohwee` or `!ole`!

      **Listeners** - I'll say these when you say the right things in your messages, such as `adonis` `superman`! They'll pop up even if you don't expect them to!

      **Snowflake Mode** - A super-special troll mode for all you special snowflakes out there!

      **Help Topics**
      Use the following commands to learn more about me! Ooooh, wee!
    fields:
      commands:
        name: "!help commands"
        value: List all the commands I support!
      listeners:
        name: "!help listeners"
        value: List all my listeners and their trigger words!
      snowflake:
        name: "!help snowflake"
        value: Get more details on how Snowflake Mode works! Ooh, wee!

      Sometimes, you just gotta troll someone, right? Snowflake Mode does just that!

      Turning it on will make me respond to everyone's messages and even change their nickname!

      I'll keep going until you say the safe word and decide to retreat to your safe space!

      **Snowflake Mode Commands**
    fields:
      snowflake:
        name: "!snowflake"
        value: Turns on Snowflake Mode! I'll start annoying anyone that hasn't retreated to their safe space!
      on:
        name: "!snowflake on"
        value: Turns on Snowflake Mode (the same as `!snowflake`)!
      off:
        name: "!snowflake off"
        value: Turns off Snowflake Mode for everyone!
      force:
        name: "!snowflake force"
        value: Turns on Snowflake Mode for everyone, even those already in their safe space! Can only be run by fellow snowflakes, though!
      doody:
        name: "i made a doody"
        value: The message you can type to retreat to your safe space...I'll leave you alone after you say this!
